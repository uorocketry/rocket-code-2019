TODO list for reading from EEPROM

Create switch case for every velocity box and altitude box
	Velocity: 16 cases, sets first 4 bits for address.

	Altitude: 32 cases, sets last 5 bits for address.

Concatanate the two binary values.

Use the first 8 bits for EEPROM adress, which gets 8 bits, last bit on the original 
binary number will refer to either the first half or second half of the new binary number.
